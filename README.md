### A basic music player using Javascript native logic.
### Link project: [Music Player](https://github.com/trongphu567/music-player/)
### The player has some features:
1. render songs
2. scroll top
3. play / pause / seek
4. CD rotate
5. next / prev
6. random songs
7. next / repeat when song ended
8. active song
9. scroll active song into view
10. play song when click

In the future, I will add more features to finish the player, such as:
- Don't save music data in local, using API server to save.
- Add / Delete song out of playlist.
- Add song into favorite playlist.
- Add context menu when clicked on option button's song.
- Search songs.
- Create a personal playlist.

Thank you F8 for guiding me to complete this mini project.
